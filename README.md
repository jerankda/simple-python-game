# python-platformer-game

First attempt at using the pygame Library to make a base for a platformer game.
This code is a simple game using the Pygame library. It creates a screen and a player object, which is a rectangle that can move around the screen and collide with walls. The walls are defined in a list of strings, with W representing a wall and spaces representing open space. The player can move using the arrow keys and will stop when it collides with a wall.
